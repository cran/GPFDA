Description: Functionalities for modelling functional data with 
    multidimensional inputs, multivariate functional data, and non-separable 
    and/or non-stationary covariance structure of function-valued processes. 
    In addition, there are functionalities for functional regression models where 
    the mean function depends on scalar and/or functional covariates and 
    the covariance structure depends on functional covariates. 
    The development version of the package can be found on
